# hulln.github.io

## Overview
Welcome to my personal/portfolio website! This site is currently in its early development stages, serving as a platform for me to explore CSS, JS, and website structuring. Although it's basic and lacks substantial content for now, I'll continuously update and enhance its functionality and design as I learn more.

2. Commit your changes to the `gh-pages` branch.
3. Navigate to your repository's settings on GitHub.
4. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
5. Choose the `gh-pages` branch as the source.
