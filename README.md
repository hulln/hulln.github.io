## Overview
This is my personal/portfolio website, currently in its early development stages. While it's still basic and lacks substantial content, this project serves as a platform for me to delve into CSS, JS, and website structuring. As I continue to learn, I'll be updating and improving the website's functionality and design.

## Repository Structure

Within the `src` folder, you'll find the following:
- `assets`: CSS, JS, SASS, and other assets,
- `images`: images,
- `other`: other source files.

The folder `old` preserves the previous website design, inspired by the Hyperspace theme by HTML5 UP ([html5up.net](https://html5up.net)). Additionally, the `orig` folder contains the original code for this previous website, including a sample for a general page. The original [README.txt](orig/README.txt) file is also included.

## License

At present, this website is not covered by any specific license. When applicable, further details will be provided in the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file upon upload.

## Credits

The current version of the website was created by me, with invaluable assistance from [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/).
