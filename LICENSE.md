## BootstrapMade Free Template License

All templates listed at [BootstrapMade.com](https://bootstrapmade.com/) are available for free download. You can use the free versions in your personal or commercial projects as long as you comply with our license. We also offer paid/pro versions with more options and features. It is also a good option to test, check the code, and find out which template will work best for you. You can upgrade to the pro version later without losing your customization.
